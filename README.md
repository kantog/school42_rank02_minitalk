This is the sixth project I did for the Campus 19 Common Core (part of the international 42 Network): communicating between a client and a server using UNIX signals.

Allowed external functions: write, signal, sigemptyset, sigaddset, sigaction, kill, getpid, malloc, free, pause, sleep, usleep, exit, read.

Score: 100/100 + 'outstanding project'
